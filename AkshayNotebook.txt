Group met to work on the 445 team proposal for our footballytics project. We went over design requirements and revised our block diagram while creating
detailed weekly checkpoints and goals we wish to achieve. We were able to complete a rough draft proposal including Problem and Solution Statements, Block Diagram, Design subsystem overviews, and an Ethics/Safety portion.

-Created most of the schematic for the pcb. Will include the Li-Ion Charging capabilities. BNO055 is a 9 axis module that has already been created making makerfab. But I took initiaitive in finding the schematic for the design and replicating it onto Kicad. I only have an issue now with the esp32 moudle. This module will work on relaying GPS information and our data via bluetooth. I have yet to find the schematic online. I have also begun compiling a parts list that we will need for the project.
