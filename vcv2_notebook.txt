Week 1: 2/6-2/13: Proposal
Week 2: 2/13-2/20: Rough draft of design doc
2/6/23
-Began our rough draft of project proposal
-Added block diagram, design requirements, 
2/7/23
-Went over basic writing requirements of proposal with TA
2/9/23
-Submitted proposal
2/14/23
-Nailed down parts we are using(ESP32 microcontroller, DW1000 UWB module, BOSCH bno055 sensor module, battery that provides 3.3V
2/16/23
-Charging module
-Nailed down current draw of each part 
-Longest football game 82 mins so battery must last for four hours
Esp32 - 240 mA 3.6 v
DW1000- 70 mA at 3.3 volts
BOSCH BN005 - 12.3 mA 3.6 v
Total amp hours 240+70+12.3=322.3 mA
Commercial 3.7 mAH Li Ion batteries at .2 current capacity to deliver four hours
https://www.adafruit.com/product/2011 2000 maH and .2 capacity at 4 hours
3.7 volts so we need a load

ESP32 PIN1 VDDA
DW1000 VDDAON PIN 25
BOSCH PIN 3 VDD
2/18/23
-Drew basic kicad schematic for recharging a 3.7 Li battery
-Began rough draft of design doc
2/19/23
-Wrote tolerance analysis
-tried to calculate newtons on our ball during basic football play
-worried about punt as it is a kick directly on location of pcb
-Added to subsystem of charging module and actuation in design doc
