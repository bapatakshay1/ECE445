2/6/23
-Began our rough draft of project proposal
-Added block diagram, design requirements, 

2/7/23
-Went over basic writing requirements of proposal with TA

2/9/23
-Submitted proposal

2/14/23
-Nailed down parts we are using(ESP32 microcontroller, DW1000 UWB module, BOSCH bno055 sensor module, battery that provides 3.3V

2/16/23
-Charging module
-Nailed down current draw of each part 
-Longest football game 82 mins so battery must last for four hours
Esp32 - 240 mA 3.6 v
DW1000- 70 mA at 3.3 volts
BOSCH BN005 - 12.3 mA 3.6 v
Total amp hours 240+70+12.3=322.3 mA
Commercial 3.7 mAH Li Ion batteries at .2 current capacity to deliver four hours
https://www.adafruit.com/product/2011 2000 maH and .2 capacity at 4 hours
3.7 volts so we need a load
ESP32 PIN1 VDDA
DW1000 VDDAON PIN 25
BOSCH PIN 3 VDD
2/18/23: Starting design doc
-Drew basic kicad schematic for recharging a 3.7 Li battery
-Began rough draft of design doc

2/19/23: Finalizng design doc for TA meetng
-Wrote tolerance analysis
-tried to calculate newtons on our ball during basic football play
-Worried about punt as it is a kick directly on location of pcb
-Added to subsystem of charging module and actuation in design doc

2/21/23
-Adding detail to charging module subsytem(battery, recharge circuit, Micro-USB)
-Do schematics need to be on our design doc, and testing physical conditions?
-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRd9uTwg7r4 for the charging circuit design
-Wrote to Jason and found that we can't use the devkit ESP32, emailing him to see if we can use it for anchors, also might need a stencil(solder paste?), also might need to "build" bosch from smaller parts

-Height may be a problem for UWB. Since tags measure distance to anchors and ball is moving through z axis, it may not be possible to know correct xy without z componenet. Might use barometer to determine height. Also seems like height was easily determined in this resource: https://kinexon.com/blog/why-ultra-wide-band-technology-has-been-scoring-points-in-basketball-for-years/#:~:text=A%20big%20plus%3A%20In%20contrast,in%20all%20directions%2C%20including%20height

2/23/23
-Worked on design doc(formatting spacing)
-Bosch to ESP32: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-with-bmp180-barometric-sensor/

2/24/23
-Turned in team contract

2/27/23
-Prepared for design doc presentation tomorrow, basic rehearsal

2/28/23
-Design doc review today
-LDO for battery charger, can't use resistive load according to Prof Gruev
-Need to look at communication protocols for our sensor; deeper understanding of that


3/06/23
-Have to finish KiCAD schematic by Wed 4:45
-If we finish schematic we can design the enclosure for PCB

3/07/23
-KiCAD schematic finish today for week 1 PCB order
-Want to use TPS from TI as LDO model but not in stock anywhere

3/20/23
-Parts are here so we can begin breadboarding

3/21/23
-Parts here 

3/24/23
-ESP32/DW1000/BOSCH etc all have castellated vias, we cannot test these parts on a breadboard without use of a jig using header strips

3/25/23
-We want to get the esp32 module with pins and a dw1000 seperate because that will better reflect our final product
-No presoldered board for dw1000 specifically, so we need to solder onto a breakout board

3/26/23
-ESP32 presoldered boards ordered
-Individual progress report due Wed

3/27/23
-Attended PCB review session. Found that we don't need to buy stencil on our own; comes with PCBway order
